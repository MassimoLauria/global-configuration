The files in this repository configure several tools to send, receive,
and  compose email  with a  tool chain  that is  independent from  the
platform and from the email client (MUA).

- =offlineimaprc=:  offlineimap  is  the  tool used  to  download  the
  emails from an IMAP account. In this case a GMail account.

- =msmtprc=: msmtp  is the tool used  (by mutt, emacs or  whatever) to
  send emails.

- =goobookrc=: goobook, a python tool,  access GMail contact lists and
  show query results in a way which integrates with mutt.

All  such files  need account  information to  access GMail.  To avoid
having  the  passwords   in  cleartext,  the  tools   use  scripts  to
save/update account informations in the keyring.

- =offlineimap_helper.py=: a  generic tool to save/read  passwords and
  mail account information from/in the keyring.

- =msmtp-gnomekeyring-manager.py=:  tool to  save account  information
  in the keyring, in a way that satisfies =mstmp= format.

- =offlineimap.daemon.plist= script needed to  launch offlineimap as a
  demon.
