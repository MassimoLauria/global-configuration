To make GDB  work in macos we need to do code signing.

See: https://timnash.co.uk/getting-gdb-to-semi-reliably-work-on-mojave-macos/

The following worked on Macosx Ventura

* Creating a new certificate isnâ€™t particularly complicated:

   - Open up Keychain Access
   - Select Certificate Assistant -> Create a Certificate
   - give it a name gdb-cert, type is self-signed root and Certificate
     Type is Code Signing. Finally, tick the Let me override defaults
     (this is important)
   - It will warn you, you are about to create a certificate (because
     this might have been a shock) click continue
   - For serial number and validity length, you can leave as, or
     change. then click continue
   - The other certificate information can be left blank and just
     click continue
   - 2048 Key size and Algorithm RSA which should be defaults just
     click continue
   - Next 3 you can just click Continue
   - Specify a Location, make sure you choose the Keychain option of
     System

With a certificate created, *restart the machine*. Yes there are other
ways to do this, but trust me its just easier to restart and be sure
everything is working.

* Sign the gdb binary

Prepare an XML file ~gdb.xml~, because using it will let
us use gdb without sudo. Such a file could be...

#+BEGIN_SRC xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.debugger</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
#+END_SRC

Then run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
codesign --entitlements gdb.xml -fs gdb-cert $(which gdb)
#+END_SRC

to sign gdb.
