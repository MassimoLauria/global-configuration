Few fixes are necessary in order to use Mac OSX

* Install iTerm terminal program

  Toggle off “Draw bold text in bold  font” if the ZSH prompt has gaps
  between the lines.

  If Option and Command keys are  swapped at global level, do not swap
  them inside iTerm.

  Preferences    ->   General    ->   load    setting   from    folder
  $HOME/config/macosx

* Developer tools

  It  is possible  to  install command  line  developer tools  without
  xcode, by simply launching, say, 'git' and answer the dialog box.

* Brew

  install brew and then various utilities.

* Window managing

  Install Amethyst.

  Set up  the Command+n  keys to move  between spaces,  since Amethyst
  cannot  set them.  Still  haven't  figure it  out  how  to move  app
  between spaces.

  (Figure out how to configure with a text file, which is possible)
